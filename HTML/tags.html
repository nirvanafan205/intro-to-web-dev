<!--
	p – Paragraph. You'll put a paragraph of text together inside of a p tag.

<!--
	ol, ul, and li – Both ol and ul represent lists.
	A ul is an unordered list: it's a list of things that could be shuffled and still mean the same thing.

	An ol is an organized list: what comes first matters

	In either list, each item in the list is an li.
-->

<ol>
	<li>This will be number one</li>
	<li>This will be number two</li>
	<li>This will be number three</li>
</ol>

<!--
	img – An image. You use this to load images onto the page. This can be confusing because you can use CSS to bring in images too.
	The key difference is that when the image is apart of the content, like a diagram that shows data you're talking about or a picture that shows something from the article, it should be an img tag.
	If it's a nice background image or something that's for decoration of your website, use CSS.
	An img tag needs a src to say where the image is coming from and alt to say what is in the image for screen readers so that the image will still be useful to blind people, people who are hard of seeing

<!--
	select and option — Sometimes you want to limit a user to a certain group of options to select from.

	A select is a user-interactive input that a user can select an option from a dropdown menu.
	An option is one of the available options. Each option needs a value that will be sent back to the server if the user select that option.
	What's inside of the option is what shown to the user
-->

	<input placeholder="Last Name" />
</form>
