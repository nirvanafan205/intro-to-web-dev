<!--Attributes allow you to modify behavior of an HTML attribute-->


<h3 class="the-red-one bolded">This one is red</h3>
<h3 class="the-blue-one">This one is blue</h3>

<!--
	attributes like class and id that are universal and can be applied to (nearly) all tags.
	These themselves are inert; they don't do anything, but allow other things to find them later
-->

<style>
	.the-red-one {
		color: red;
	}

	.the-blue-one {
		color: blue;
	}

	.bolded {
		font-weight: bold;
	}
</style>


<!--
	Classes are far more useful.
	However there are IDs that you may need occasionally. 
	A key thing is that an ID is unique.
	Whereas I've already used the the-red-one class twice, you can't do with IDs.
	They're designed to not be reusable; they're unique to the page
